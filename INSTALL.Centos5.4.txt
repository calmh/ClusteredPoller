Super Short Installation Instructions for CentOS 5.4
====================================================

Install Git from the Webtatic repository by following these
instructions:

  http://www.webtatic.com/blog/2009/09/git-on-centos-5/

Install g++ and necessary development libraries:

  sudo yum install gcc-g++ net-snmp-devel mysql-devel

Download the MySQL++ library and development files (two RPM:s) from here
and install them:

  http://tangentsoft.net/mysql++/

Clone the clpoll respository from github:

  git clone git://github.com/calmh/ClusteredPoller.git

Build and test clpoll:

  cd ClusteredPoller ; make

The last lines of compiler output should indicate that unit tests passed
without failures. You now have a hopefully working clpoll binary. Follow
the instructions in README.
